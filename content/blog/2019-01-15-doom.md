As you have come this far I am assuming you are very keen on **diet and weight loss**. It could be you are having trouble with your weight?

Whatever your intention is, I assure you, you will enjoy it here.

Now let's get back to the point,

**WHAT ARE THE BEST KETO SECRETS?**

Before that let me remind you of a story!

We all know **Adele** and her famous come back in the weight loss journey. Adele had lost **“approximately 150 pounds”** from 2008 to 2020. Amazing right!

What we don't know is how she did it exactly. Yes, we know that her

professional trainer **Pete Geracimo**, helped her to achieve this goal.

When following the celebrity story and the exciting parts, a sudden it falls apart. We get busy, forgot things we want to do or achieve.

We lost our track in the fast-growing culture that distracts us from our goal very often.

Come back to that point about our celebrity inspiration, let’s be honest. About how many people are there who can afford high paying trainers?

I am not accusing celebrities they have that ability and luxury to

provide but can we all have that luxury?

Let’s not forget the effort she gave. **“2008-2020” 12 years!!** long time right.

Now here is the thing I want to point out when you release this, you get the state of inspiration to disappointment.

Soon you realize from your heart this is not for me I can't do this.

Yes, it’s not your fault at all.

Let me cover some facts about keto if you don’t do it correctly. Don’t take my words. Check what the **doctors and dietitians opinion**. I know It all seems boring. I will address some quotes from the articles. I will also provide you the link if you like to check further.

“The ketogenic diet can definitely result in a drop in libido when starting the diet, as the dieter will be experiencing symptoms of carb withdrawal and potentially the keto flu,” noted [Dr. Nancy P. Rahnama](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blog/post/edit/3905988030586880972/2025725202579044602#), a bariatric and internal medicine doctor based in California.

“Dehydration is serious and may result in lightheadedness, kidney injury, or kidney stones.

This may put the dieter at risk of a cardiac arrhythmia, as electrolytes are necessary for the normal beating of the heart,

“Electrolyte deficiencies are serious and may result in an irregular heartbeat, which can be deadly.” [Dr. Rahnama ](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blog/post/edit/3905988030586880972/2025725202579044602#)added.

“If trying to go keto causes you to yo-yo and go off and on diets, that has impacts related to weight fluctuations and increased mortality risk,” added [Sharon Palmer, a dietitian from California.](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blog/post/edit/3905988030586880972/2025725202579044602#)

“There is a fear among health experts that such high intakes of unhealthful fats would have a long-term negative effect,” she explained.

For adults following the ketogenic diet, the most common complications include weight loss, constipation, and increased levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. Women may also experience amenorrhea or other disruptions to the [menstrual cycle.](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blog/post/edit/3905988030586880972/2025725202579044602#)
